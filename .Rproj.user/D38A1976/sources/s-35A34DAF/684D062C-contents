#  Data Replication Assignment 

First, we will read in the dataset and check for normality.
```{r}
# Load in specimen name/variable dataset and name it "SpecData"
SpecData <- read.csv("specvariable_repdata.csv")
head(SpecData)
summary(SpecData)
```

Now that we have the data loaded in we want to recreate the first set of boxplots based on dental topography measurements for 5 types of feeding behaviors measured in the Winchester et al. (2014) paper. 

```{r}
boxplot(log(Body_mass_female_mean)~Family,d)
```
